**Task Manager Application**

**Project Description:**

This Android application is a task management tool built with Jetpack Compose. It allows users to easily manage their tasks with features such as...

    1. Add Tasks: Users can enter task descriptions into a text field and add them to a list.
    2. Complete Tasks: A checkbox system allows users to mark tasks as done, which toggles a strikethrough effect on the text.
    3. Delete Tasks: Tasks can be removed using the dedicated delete icon.
    4. Persistent State: The app utilizes mutableStateListOf and remember to ensure the UI stays synchronized with the underlying data.
    5. Responsive Design: A scrolling LazyColumn ensures the app remains functional even with a large number of tasks.
